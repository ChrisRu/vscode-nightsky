## User Installation

1.  Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`

2.  Search for `Night Sky` - find the one by **ChrisRu** - there are a few other half-baked ones so make sure you have the right one!

3.  Click **Install** to install it.

4.  Click **Reload** to reload the your editor

5.  Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Night Sky**

## Development

1. Install the dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm install`

2. In VSCode, open the debug window (Ctrl+Shift+D) and start a debug window of VSCode that automatically reloads on changes.

3. (Optionally) use command (Ctrl+Shift+P) `Debugger: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` to find the token identifiers for easier development

## Inspiration

This theme is inspired by the Ocean Next theme and Plastic deprioritized punctuation theme and modified to style the sidebar and have a darker background.

## Publish details

This extension is both published to [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/) and the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
